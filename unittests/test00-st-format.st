DESCRIPTION: """
Takes a critical look at the practice of selectively engaging with dharma, this article argues for a nuanced approach.  There are many commonalities in values and practices found in many global traditions that could be termed 'dharmic', and it calls for a conscious 'dharmic appropriation' in order to create meaningful personal and collective paths.

TEXT: """
"You're Cherry-picking The Dharma!"

Well, Yes.  I mean, No.  I mean, what?  "The" Dharma? There are many dharmas! Not all of them have a capital D. But all of them have commonalities in terms of values and practices.

So it's not really cherry-picking. It's more like dharmic appropriation, if you will permit me to be a little provocative.

So what exactly *is* "dharma".  Dharma is a complex and multifaceted concept that embodies principles of law, lore, duty, virtue, way, and the inherent nature of existence.  It represents a moral and ethical compass guiding individuals to live in alignment with their true self, and the universal values that govern their world.  

Depending on cultural and philosophical contexts, dharma may emphasize different aspects, such as *duty* in Hinduism and South East Asian cultures, *the teachings* of Buddha in the various Buddhisms, the *righteous path* in Jainism, the *Tikanga* of the Maori, the *Moran* of the Maasai, *bushido* of Japanese samurai, the "All Blacks Way" of the New Zealand rugby team, and so on.

Ultimately, a dharma emphasises what is *done* as a consequence of the values that are believed, or held to be self-evident, and which to some extent become internalised within an individual or group.  

Appropriating from, learning from, or simply appreciating, different expressions of dharma should be something 
is what peoplefrom ancient to present times, 
from whoever they are, and 
from wherever they may be.

Why do dharmas even exist? Why are there so many? And why do they look so different?  Are they really that different?

It's about selecting basic wisdoms and practices from the consensus of the global wise, that most suit our own environments, conditions and paths.

This commonality is a great resource for developing resilient personal and group dharmas that are able to influence and guide with wisdom and compassion, as an alternative to reactivity and hate.

In pursuit of wisdom and compassion, the conscious act of dharmic appropriation invites us to explore, select, and integrate teachings from across the world across all cultures and ways.

It allows us to create a paths/ways that respects diversity of thought, while embracing the postive universal values that bind us. It's not about cherry-picking, but about forging a personal and collective dharma that resonates with a sense of our shared humanity.
