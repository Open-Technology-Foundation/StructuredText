Stanford University. Ok, let's get going. First off, apologies for Friday. Sometimes what seems like a flawless set of connecting flights on paper turns out not to be in reality. Hopefully, people managed to make good use of the time.

We then moved on to discuss the concept of selection, comparing it to the heart of a giraffe undergoing the same sort of wind tunnel of selection. This whole process follows certain rules. By adhering to these rules, we could generate fairly structured predictions about social behavior.

The "we win" version of using that is as follows: "Here's what we predict. Here is the way we explain this complex system of social behavior using these rules." These rules assume certain degrees of heritability of behavior following certain rules of evolution. Until you come up with a better explanation for how this goes on, we win. This is how behavior works.

Then we shifted over to the molecular end. On a certain sort of trendy level, molecular biology is the answer to the people who would sit around to the social biologist and say, "Show me the genes, show me the genes for what you keep talking about inferentially." What we saw was how evolutionary change works out from the DNA level, which is very important.
